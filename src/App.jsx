                  I started BunnyIndex because I couldn't find what I was looking for — a beauty directory that let me search by ingredient and skin concern, not just browse a list of brands. When you have specific skin needs, "cruelty-free favorites" roundups don't cut it. I wanted to search for oil-free SPF with niacinamide, or fragrance-free moisturizers for sensitive skin, and actually get results.
                </p>
                <p className="body" style={{ fontSize: 15, color: "var(--ink-soft)", lineHeight: 1.75 }}>
                  The other thing that frustrated me was how murky "cruelty-free" had become. A lot of brands carry the label but are owned by parent companies that test on animals. That always felt like a loophole — and I didn't want to support it.
                </p>
                <div style={{ background: "var(--terra-pale)", borderLeft: "3px solid var(--terra)", padding: "16px 20px", borderRadius: "0 4px 4px 0" }}>
                  <p className="body" style={{ fontSize: 15, color: "var(--ink-soft)", lineHeight: 1.75 }}>
                    So I built BunnyIndex to hold a higher standard. Every brand here is independently cruelty-free — not just at the product level but at the ownership level. No parent companies that test. No selling in markets that require animal testing. If a brand doesn't meet that bar, it doesn't make the index. No exceptions.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <p className="body" style={{ fontSize: 15, color: "var(--ink-soft)", lineHeight: 1.75 }}>
                  My goal is simple: make it easier to find products that actually work for your skin, from brands that actually mean what they say.
